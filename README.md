Sure, here's a simple README that explains the hierarchy of the functions in your `WaterConservationApp`:

# Water Conservation App

This application allows you to track water usage, conservation tips, and water conditions. It provides methods to add, update, retrieve, and delete data related to water usage, conservation tips, and water conditions.

## Usage

Here's the order in which you might want to call the functions:

1. **Add Data**: Start by adding some data. You can add water usage, conservation tips, and water conditions.

```rust
add_water_usage(50.0);
add_conservation_tip("Save water!".to_string());
add_water_condition("Location".to_string(), 100.0);
```

2. **Get Data**: Once you've added some data, you can retrieve it using the `get` methods. These methods take an `id` and return the corresponding data.

```rust
get_water_usage(1);
get_conservation_tip(1);
get_water_condition(1);
```

3. **List All Data**: You can also list all the data of a certain type using the `list_all` methods.

```rust
list_all_water_usages();
list_all_conservation_tips();
list_all_water_conditions();
```

4. **Update Data**: If you want to update some data, you can use the `update` methods. These methods take an `id` and the new data, and update the corresponding data.

```rust
update_water_usage(1, 60.0);
update_conservation_tip(1, "Conserve water!".to_string());
update_water_condition(1, "New Location".to_string(), 200.0);
```

5. **Delete Data**: Finally, if you want to delete some data, you can use the `delete` methods. These methods take an `id` and delete the corresponding data.

```rust
delete_water_usage(1);
delete_conservation_tip(1);
delete_water_condition(1);
```

## Testing

You can test these functions by calling them in the order described above. Make sure to handle the `Option` return type correctly: these functions will return `None` if the data is not found.

Remember, each function operates on the `WaterConservationApp` instance stored in the `StableBTreeMap` with the key `0`. If you have multiple instances stored under different keys, you'll need to adjust the code accordingly.
